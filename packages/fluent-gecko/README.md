# fluent-gecko

`fluent-gecko` is a Gecko-compatible distribution of Project Fluent,
a localization framework designed to unleash the expressive power of the
natural language.


## How to use

The `fluent-gecko` build system produces `*.jsm` files which are ready to be
used as Gecko modules.

`Fluent.jsm` exports the `FluentBundle` constructor which provides the
core functionality of formatting translations from FTL files.  See the
[README][] of the main `fluent` package for more information.
