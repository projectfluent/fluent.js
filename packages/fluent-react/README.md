# fluent-react

`fluent-react` provides React bindings for Project Fluent, a localization
framework designed to unleash the expressive power of the natural language.


## Installation

`fluent-react` can be used both on the client-side and the server-side.  You
can install it from the npm registry or use it as a standalone script (as the
`FluentReact` global).

    npm install fluent-react


# Integrating with React apps

`fluent-react` takes advantage of React's Components system and the virtual
DOM.  Translations are exposed to components via the _provider_ pattern.

There are many approaches to fetching and storing translations.  To allow
maximum flexibility, `fluent-react` expects the developer to write a little bit
of a setup code related to language negotiation and translation fetching.  It
makes `fluent-react` unopinionated and suitable for many different scenarios.
You will likely also need to install a few other packages: `fluent`,
`fluent-langneg` and `fluent-intl-polyfill`.

Consult the [wiki][] for documentation on how to set up and use `fluent-react`.

## Compatibility

For legacy browsers, the `compat` build has been transpiled using Babel's [env
preset][]:

```javascript
import 'fluent-react/compat';
```

In some cases, using the `compat` build may be needed even if you target
modern browsers. For instance, the [`create-react-app` boilerplate uses
UglifyJS to minify its files][create-react-app-minify]. As of November 2017,
UglifyJS doesn't support some of the new JavaScript syntax features. By using
the `compat` build of all `fluent` packages you can ensure that the
minifiction works properly.
