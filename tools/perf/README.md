# Perf testing

Measure the performance impact of changes that you make to the fluent.js
codebase.

Execution time is reported in milliseconds (ms).

The script measures the speed of parsing, compilation and getting all entities
from a resource file based on Firefox OS's [Settings localization file][]. The
file consists of ca. 500 entities, majority of which are simple key-value
pairs. This aims to immitate a real-life scenario in which only a handful of
entities make use of Project Fluent's advanced features.

[settings localization file]: https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/blob/v1.0.1/apps/settings/locales/settings.en-US.properties

Usage: test.js [options] command

Options:

    -h, --help                 output usage information
    -V, --version              output the version number
    -e, --engine <string>      Engine to test: node, jsshell, d8 [node]
    -s, --sample <int>         Sample size [30]
    -p, --progress             Show progress
    -n, --no-color             Print without color
    -r, --raw                  Print raw JSON
    -c, --compare <reference>  Compare with a reference JSON
    -a, --alpha <float>        Significance level for the t-test [0.01]

The `command` argument is the command that will be spawned via
`child_process.exec`. This allows to reliably measure the speed over a big
sample of runs without triggering JIT compilation of the modern JavaScript
engines. The command is always executed with `tools/perf` being the current
directory. If not given, the value of `command` will be determined based on
the value ot the `engine` argument.

Examples:

    ./test.js
    ./test.js --engine jsshell
    ./test.js --sample 1000 --progress
    ./test.js --raw > ~/reference.js
    ./test.js --compare ~/reference.js
    ./test.js "~/src/jsshell/js benchmark.jsshell.js"

## Statistical significance

You can save raw JSON output to a file to serve as a benchmark for future
measurements. Afer you make edits to the codebase, re-run `perf` with
`--compare path/to/reference.json` to see relative changes of new means.

The differences are tested for statistical significance with a two-sample
[t-test][] with a default significance level of 0.01. If the difference is
significant, it will be show in green (faster) or red (slower).

## High Resolution Timer (HRT)

All numbers are reported in millisecods (ms) via node's
[process.hrtime][] or SpiderMonkey shell's [dateNow][]. This allows to
measure the time of a single operation.
