# Project Fluent

Fluent.js is a JavaScript implementation of Project Fluent, a localization
framework designed to unleash the expressive power of the natural language.

Project Fluent keeps simple things simple and makes complex things possible.
The syntax used for describing translations is easy to read and understand. At
the same time it allows, when necessary, to represent complex concepts from
natural languages like gender, plurals, conjugations, and others.

## Packages

Fluent.js consists of a set of packages which have different use-cases and can
be installed independently of each other.

- [@fluent/bundle](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent.js/tree/master/fluent-bundle)
- [@fluent/dedent](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent.js/tree/master/fluent-dedent)
- [@fluent/dom](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent.js/tree/master/fluent-dom)
- [@fluent/langneg](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent.js/tree/master/fluent-langneg)
- [@fluent/react](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent.js/tree/master/fluent-react)
- [@fluent/sequence](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent.js/tree/master/fluent-sequence)
- [@fluent/syntax](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent.js/tree/master/fluent-syntax)

You can install each of the above packages via `npm`, e.g. `npm install @fluent/react`.  
See the end of this `README` for instructions on how to build `fluent.js` locally.

## Learn the FTL syntax

FTL is a localization file format used for describing translation resources.
FTL stands for _Fluent Translation List_.

FTL is designed to be simple to read, but at the same time allows to represent
complex concepts from natural languages like gender, plurals, conjugations,
and others.

    hello-user = Hello, { $username }!

[Read the Fluent Syntax Guide][] in order to learn more about the syntax. If
you're a tool author you may be interested in the formal [EBNF grammar][].

encourage everyone to take a look at our code and we'll listen to your
feedback.

## Local Development

Hacking on `fluent.js` is easy! To quickly get started clone the repo:

    $ git clone https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent.js.git
    $ cd fluent.js

You'll need at least **Node.js 12** and **npm v7**.
Older versions are not supported.

Install the dependencies used by all packages, which are managed as
[npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces):

    $ npm install

Build and test all packages at once:

    $ npm run dist

â€¦which is equivalent to:

    $ npm run clean
    $ npm run build --workspaces
    $ npm run lint
    $ npm run test
    $ npm run docs --workspaces

Each package may also be built separately by running `npm run build` in
its directory.
