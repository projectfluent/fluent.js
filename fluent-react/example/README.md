# @fluent/react Example

This tiny React app demonstrates how `@fluent/react` can integrate with React.

## Running

The example app requires a local build of `@fluent/react`. In the root of the
`fluent.js` clone install the build tools:

    cd fluent.js/
    npm install

Then build `@fluent/react`:

    cd fluent.js/fluent-react/
    npm install
    make

Finally, change back to this directory, and build the example:

    cd fluent.js/fluent-react/example/
    npm install
    npm start

Open http://localhost:1234 to see the example running.
