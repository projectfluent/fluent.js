# fluent-react examples

These tiny React apps demonstrate how `fluent-react` can integrate with React.
To run each example, `cd` into that folder and run the following commands:

    npm install
    npm start

__Note__: Because these examples require your local version of `fluent-react`,
you need to build that first.

In the root of this git repository (`fluent.js/`), run:

    npm install

Then in `fluent.js/fluent-react/`, run:

    npm install
    make
